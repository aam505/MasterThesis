\section{Conclusion}


We ran several pilots to see if it is feasible that participants believe they are co-located with other players and that at the end of the rope there is another human. We investigate whether participants actually feel the rope is being pulled more in one condition despite this not being implemented in any way. The question is whether appearance change in virtual reality can provide a working illusion and create a belief that is manifested in a measurable way, namely in the performance of players.
If we cannot convince players they are co-located, then we frame our experiment in the context of designing a system to simulate force in a distributed way. Participants will be told we made a device and we are exploring its feasibility to be used in games as a distributed force transmitter. 
To increase the belief in agency, participants are told to wave at each player before starting the game. Avatars making some form of acknowledgement of the other player will increase the believably they have agency.
